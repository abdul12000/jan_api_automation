  Scenario Outline: Test that existing comments can be retreived with a GET request
    Given service is up and running
    When i search for "<id>" of a comment with a GET method
    Then i should get the correct "<id>", "<name>", "<email>" and "<body>" returned with status code of 200
    Examples:
      | id | name|email                                                                      | body                                                                                                                                                              |
